Currently this repo consists of three root finding methods and one matrix manipulation method program.



 


## Task_101 (Matrix Multiplication)
Takes two matrix as input from the user.
Prints the max element of the first matrix and the product of two matrix if multiplication is possible.

## Task_102 (Bisection Method)
Takes any polynomial function f(x) = 0 from the user as input and uses the bisection method to print the root of the function alongside graph of the function and root.
## Task_103 (False Position Method)
Takes any polynomial function f(x) = 0 from the user as input and uses the regula falsi/false position method to print the root of the function alongside graph of the function and root.
## Task_104 (Newton-Raphson Method)
Takes any polynomial function f(x) = 0 from the user as input and uses the newton raphson method to print the root of the function alongside graph of the function and root.
